                <h2>Quilts and the African American Community</h2>
                <p>Many families and peple of the African American Community can say they've got a quilt. Family hierloooms being passed down from mother to daughter, and so on. The concept of quilts had originated all the way back to the time of slavery. Slaveowners would often force enslaved Africans to sew them quilts, they were made to be the best of the best. Often times in the tragedy and saddness of slavery, they would use the scraps of the fabric used for the quilts and make their own. It was even seen as a community activity, to get away from the throughts of slavery and oppresion. These quilts have been passde down through generations.</p>

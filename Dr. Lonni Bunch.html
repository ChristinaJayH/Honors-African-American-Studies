                <h2>The National African American Museum</h2>
                <p> Lonnie G. Bunch III, the first director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, turned a dream into a reality by leading the museum’s growth from scratch with no team, money, or location to becoming a major cultural spot in New York. Through his leadership and commitment, he obtained a collection of 40,000 objects that tell the story of African American's impact on American History. The museum, which opened in September 2016, has welcomed over 8 million visitors and stands as the nation’s largest and most comprehensive center dedicated to exploring and showcasing the African American experience.</p>

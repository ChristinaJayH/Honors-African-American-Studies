                <p>Lift every voice and sing
                    <br>Till earth and heaven ring,
                    <br>Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
                    <br>Let our rejoicing rise
                    <br>High as the listening skies,
                    <br>Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
                    <br>Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
                    <br>Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us,
                    <br>Facing the rising sun of our new day begun
                    <br>Let us march on till victory is won.</p>

                <h2>How & When</h2>
                <p>The <span>"Black National Anthum"</span> was first performed publicly by a choir of 500 schoolchildren at the segregated Stanton School in Jacksonville, Florida, to celebrate President Abraham Lincoln’s birthday. Over time, it became a powerful symbol of hope, unity, and resilience for African Americans, especially during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.</p>

            <p><span>“Lift Every Voice and Sing”</span> stands out as a lyrical masterpiece due to its profound and poignant verses that encapsulate the historical struggles and triumphs of African Americans. <br>The lyrics, penned by James Weldon Johnson in 1900, eloquently convey the journey from slavery to freedom, touching on themes of faith, hope, resilience, and unity. <br>Each line is imbued with powerful imagery and emotion, reflecting the collective experience of a marginalized community striving for equality and justice. <br>Through its evocative language and timeless message, the hymn has become a symbol of strength and perseverance for generations, earning its place as a cultural treasure in American history.</p>
